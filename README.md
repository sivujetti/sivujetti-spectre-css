## Spectre CSS

[![Reviewed by Hound](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reviewed_by-Hound-8E64B0.svg)](https://houndci.com)

> This version of Spectre CSS has been forked from the [original repo](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre); see the [organisation readme](https://github.com/spectre-org) for rationale.

Spectre is a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework.

- Lightweight (~10KB gzipped) starting point for your projects
- Flexbox-based, responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Elegantly designed and developed elements and components

Spectre is a side project based on years of CSS development work on a large web service project.

Spectre only includes modern base styles, responsive layout system, CSS components and utilities, and it can be modified for your project using standard build tools.

### Usage (Sivujetti-Spectre CSS)

Add these before or after `sivujetti-spectre.min.css`:

```css
:root {
  --spectre-primary-color: #5755d9;
  --spectre-primary-color-dark: #4b48d6; /* darken(--spectre-primary-color, 3%), you can use http://scg.ar-ch.org/ for this */
  --spectre-primary-color-light: #6361dc; /* lighten(--spectre-primary-color, 3%) */
  --spectre-secondary-color: #efeffb; /* lighten(--spectre-primary-color, 37.5%) */
  --spectre-secondary-color-dark: #e3e3f8; /* darken(--spectre-secondary-color, 3%) */
  --spectre-secondary-color-light: #fbfbfe; /* lighten(--spectre-primary-color, 3%) */
  --spectre-link-color: #5755d9; /* --spectre-primary-color */
  --spectre-link-color-dark: #302ecd; /* darken(--spectre-link-color, 10%) */
  --spectre-link-color-light: #807fe2; /* lighten(--spectre-link-color, 10%) */

## Contributing

Clone this repo locally with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-css.git
```

Spectre uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile CSS:

```bash
# compile SCSS to CSS and minify files
gulp build    

# watch file changes and re-compile
gulp watch    
```

To work with Spectre CSS source files live in another project, you can use NPM link.

In the Spectre CSS repo, create the global reference:

```bash
npm link
```

In your project repo, create the link:

```bash
npm link @spectre-org/spectre-css
```

The existing `node_modules/@spectre-org/spectre-css` folder will be replaced with a symlink to the local repository, and any changes there will be reflected immediately in your project.
